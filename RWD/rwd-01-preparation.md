# RWD 1 - Getting started

## Developing content for your portfolio

We need you to start creating content for the 'responsive' portfolio web site you are about to develop over the coming weeks for **Assessment Two**.

[Heidi Cohen](https://twitter.com/heidicohen) describes content as:

>“High quality, useful information that conveys a story presented in a contextually relevant manner with the goal of soliciting an emotion or engagement. Delivered live or asynchronously, content can be expressed using a variety of formats including text, images, video, audio, and/or presentations.”

Well written content and high quality media is essential for the success of your portfolio.

### The theme of your content

For simplicity we’re asking you to develop the content for your portfolio based on a topic of your choice. It could include your work, hobbies, holidays or other interest. The content including text and images must be original - created by you.

- **About me** – About me – engaging text to attract and inform the user about the author of this page. You should be mindful of Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), using relevant keywords and metadata. You may want to include links to your social media feeds in this section if you have them. 150 words maximum.

- **Topic Title** – Again engaging text about your chosen topic. Include relevant links. 250 words maximum. 

In recent years some students have created successful pages by selecting a particular theme from work or home life, hobbies, sports, holidays or obsessions (often their cars). If in doubt, talk to the tutors.

## Original images for the gallery

It is important that your portfolio includes original media. Everyone has a camera in their pocket: be creative, take some original photos to illustrate your theme and to engage the user.

- Take or create three original images to illustrate your chosen topic.
- Usually these are photographs (jpeg format).
- If they are illustrations either gif, svg or png formats may be more relevant.
- If they can all be the same orientation (landscape or portrait) it does make things simpler, but is not essential.
- The images can later be sized appropriately and optimized for the web when you know more about the layout you are creating.

>You will require a 4th original image for your 'big banner', often known as the 'hero' image. This is going to be used at a much larger size. It needs to be high quality. It should be landscape. 

- Your hero image will often set the scene for your portfolio. Its colours may also influence your colour scheme (although we may use filters to change this later). You are also going to be layering text (your heading) over the image.

- If you are struggling to create a high quality hero image (you really should try) - you can download and use [a free hero image from Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/hero-image). 

- Any Unsplah image used MUST be copyright free and preferably available under the Creative Commons licence.

- Remember to keep the full size original images - always edit copies.

## A note about copyright

### Images

As a developer it is your duty to be aware of both the legal and ethical issues that your work involves. An important aspect is how copyright laws affects your work.

Many students mistakenly feel that they can use any image that they find through Google in their own work. Most images will be copyright protected, meaning you would need permission of the owner before using anything you find. This is both an ethical and legal issue - should you steal someone else’s work?

We are encouraging you to create and use your own media. If you do use a non-original image then we would like you to use [a free hero image from Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/hero-image) because we know these are copyright free.

You should always credit the creator. On the page or in your code.

### Code

It is too easy to use someone else’s code. We expect you to develop your own code (based on what we supply) because you are trying to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. Just as in Introduction to Programming, copying and pasting won’t help.

If you feel you want to use someone else’s code (as a small element of your site) you need to find out if you can explicitly do this.

Code that can be shared often has explicit instructions in comments. Much code is open source but you need to check. Likewise most code in online tutorials is free to use.

* As a student you should only use code that explicitly allows re-use.
* You must credit the author/source in a comment in your source code.
* You should only use code you understand - tutors will not debug it for you.
* You must not use code from another student’s submission.
* Whilst we encourage collaboration in the classroom, you must ensure your submission is your own.

Finally you should evaluate the efficiency of any code you use. Do you know enough about this language to be able to tell if it is well written or does it take a hundred lines to do what could be done in 5, or are there faster or more maintainable approaches?

It is also worth learning about [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) and how this can be used to share and protect your own creative output. Watch the [Creative Commons introduction video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/dPZTh2NKTm4).

## Notes

Try to have your text and images ready asap.

As the project proceeds, and you can see how your site is evolving, students often decide to *upgrade* (improve) their text and images before the final submission. You don't have to stick with the content created in the initial weeks.

## Mood board

> Note: This is a little extra, and not part of the assessment. If you don't know it or need inspiration give it a try.

One way to kick off the design process create a mood board to collate influences and ideas for the portfolio page you are about to create. This will include:

* Colours 
* Typography

Use your photographs as the starting point. Sample some of the colours, looking for a theme. Also start to think about a 'hero' image. Do you already have a suitable image? Do you need to create one?

The influences may be digital or physical.

>&ldquo;Mood boards are visually stunning collections of ideas, full of textures and images that communicate the vision of a designer at the start of a project.&rdquo;

Read the article [20 pro tips for creating inspirational mood boards](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470) before starting.

### Inspiration

Here's [a massive list of portfolio sites for inspiration](https://github.com/wilsonderren/website-inspiration). These sites will be more complex than what we are asking you to create but you can look for inspiration in colour, typography and writing styles and content.

### Creating your Mood board

You can create your mood board any way that suits, PhotoShop, PowerPoint or even a physical item.
