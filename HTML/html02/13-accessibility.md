# Accessibility

The basic elements of accessibility in relation to HTML are as follows:

## Semantic coding 

- Use the right HTML element for the right job. If it's a paragraph put it in a paragraph (`<p>`), if it's a heading, select the right level heading for the document.

- Use semantic elements to describe the structure of the document, e.g. `<nav>`, `<header>` etc.

## Validation

- De-bugging your codes ensures it will work in the browser without errors, work for assistive technologies and not add to the burden of the user.

- Valid code also future proofs your work by adhering to standards.

## Alt text

- Provide `alt` text for all images that contain important information, information that enhances the user experience.

- If the image is *fluff*, e.g. the content is unimportant such as a stock image of people in an office, then use a *null* alt - `alt=""`

## Language

- Use the `lang` attribute to define the main language of your document, and to define separate passages that use another language within your page.

## Tables

- Use `scope` to help a visually impaired person using a screen reader to navigate your table by associating table and row headings with the data cells of the table. 

## Forms

- Use `caption` and `legend` to group elements of a form.

- Use the `label` element with the `for` attribute to associate a forms label with its HTML form widget.

## ARIA Roles

Sadly we don't have space to go into the use of ARIA Roles in our coding, but Jen's video gives a brief introduction.
